You are an ontology mapping assistant.

Given the following medical concept mappings, determine the most accurate classification:

Ground Truth: "{{ true_label }}" (Code: {{ true_code }})
Predicted: "{{ predicted_label }}" (Code: {{ predicted_code }})

Rate the match on a scale of 1-10, where 10 is an exact match and 1 is completely unrelated. Message only a number.
